      <h2>Erin</h2>
      <p>
        Valerie was our wedding coordinator last year. Although I didn't think
        I needed one, I am so VERY happy I changed my mind and hired her.
        She was so easy to work with, especially when I hit those “Bridezilla”
         moments and she showed up everywhere and anywhere I asked!

      <h2>Tara</h2>
      <p>
        Sally helped us stay within our budget and yet was able to help us get
        more bang for our buck. At the wedding itself, you never knew she was
        there—everything flowed so smoothly and she made sure that we had a
        wonderful evening and were able to visit with all of our guests.

      <h2>Andrea</h2>
      <p>
        We cannot begin to thank you all enough for all you did for our party.
        The decorations were beautiful and the cake came alive when you added
        your touch with the flowers. We appreciate everything you did. I could not
        have had the perfect wedding without you!

      <p>
        From beginning to end, they took meticulous care of each and every detail.
        Most importantly, when we were stressed or had something unexpected
        “pop up” at the most inopportune time, they were there to take care
        of it quickly, effectively and KINDLY!
